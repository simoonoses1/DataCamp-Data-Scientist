# Machine Learning Models for Data Science 🤖

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of two machine learning models, **RandomForest** and **Logistic Regression**, for predicting outcomes based on a set of predictor variables. The models are implemented in R. 📊

## RandomForest 🌳
**RandomForest** is a machine learning model that averages multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of overcoming the over-fitting problem of individual decision trees. 🌲

The code first loads the `randomForest` package, divides the data into a training set and a test set using the `sample()` function, fits a random forest model to the training data using the `randomForest()` function, specifying the response variable and the predictor variables, and finally, prints a summary of the model using the `print()` function. 📝

**RandomForest** is a good choice for a baseline model because it is simple, robust, and can handle both numerical and categorical data. It also provides good performance without the need for complex parameter tuning. 🎯

## Logistic Regression 📈
**Logistic Regression** is a machine learning model that models the relationship between a dependent variable (the response variable) and one or more independent variables (the predictor variables) using a logistic function. It is a useful tool for predicting binary outcomes. 🔍

In **Logistic Regression**, the goal is to find the best fitting line or curve that can accurately predict the binary outcome based on the predictor variables. This is done by minimizing the error between the predicted values and the actual values in the training data. 📊

**Logistic Regression** is a good choice for a baseline model because it is simple to implement and interpret, and it can handle both numerical and categorical data. It is also relatively robust to overfitting, which makes it a good option for predicting binary outcomes. ✅

## Getting Started 🚀
To run the notebook, you will need to have R and Jupyter installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository and open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter. 📑
